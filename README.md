# Hardhat bodhi plugin

Hardhat bodhi plugin

## Installation

To start working on your project, just run

```bash
npm install
```

## Plugin development

Make sure to read our [Plugin Development Guide](https://hardhat.org/guides/create-plugin.html)
to learn how to build a plugin, and our
[best practices to create high-quality plugins](https://hardhat.org/advanced/building-plugins.html).

## Testing

Running `npm run test` will run every test located in the `test/` folder. They
use [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/),
but you can customize them.

We recommend creating unit tests for your own modules, and integration tests for
the interaction of the plugin with Hardhat and its dependencies.

## Linting and autoformat

All of Hardhat projects use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and
[tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

You can check if your code style is correct by running `npm run lint`, and fix
it with `npm run lint:fix`.

## Building the project

Just run `npm run build` ️👷
